# Black-Friday-Dataset-Analysis-from-Kaggle
Problem Statement:- A retail company 'ABC' want to understand the customer purchase behaviour( specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. Also build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against the products which will help them to create personalized offer for customer against different products. 
My Approach :-

1) I have taken the Black Friday dataset from Kaggle.
2) It is transactional data from a retail store capturing various customer and purchase details related to black Friday sales event.
3) I have implemented the EDA - Exploratory data analysis on this dataset steps involving such as:
       - Data Preprocessing
       - Handling Categorical variables
       - Handling missing values within dataset 
4) Next step i have performed is visualizing the between different columns through which we can gain insights from.
5) After that i have performed Feature Scaling on the dataset to standardize the range of features of data.
6) Model Training : As given in the problem statement to build the model to predict the purchase amount of customer against products.
   since it is a predictive analysis problem i have used the KNN Algorithm.
   The model accuracy is 74.9% .
